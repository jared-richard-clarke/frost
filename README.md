# Parser Combinators

Parser combinators are extremely interesting but also very complicated. 
It's the monads that confuse me. I'm going to change that.

>  `String -> Result a` for some functor `Result`) with a unit `return` and bind
>  (`>>=`) operation, and a number of parser specific operations, usually a choice
>  combinator (`<|>`) and a function `satisfy` for construction elementary parsers
>  for terminal symbols."
